  "text": "Anthropic, the startup behind the safety-focused Claude chatbot, teamed up with South Korea’s largest mobile phone provider.\nWhat’s new: The independent research lab, which is an offshoot of OpenAI, will receive $100 million from SK Telecom to build a multilingual large language model tailored for the telecommunications industry, VentureBeat reported .\nHow it works: Anthropic will base the specialized model on the technology that underpins its large language model Claude . SK Telecom plans to offer it to other telecoms firms, such as members of the Global Telco AI Alliance , a consortium devoted to building new lines of business based on AI-driven services.\nThe model will be fine-tuned for telecoms applications like customer service, marketing, and sales.\nIt will support six languages: Korean, English, German, Japanese, Arabic, and Spanish.\nClaude takes advantage of constitutional AI , a method designed to align large language models and human values based on a set of principles, or constitution. Initially, the model critiques and refines its own responses according to the constitution. Then it’s fine-tuned on the results via supervised learning. This is followed by a phase that Anthropic calls reinforcement learning from AI feedback, or RLAIF.\nBehind the news: SK Telecom has a history of building its own machine learning models, particularly Korean-language models. The company emulated GPT-3's architecture to train models like Ko-GPT-Trinity-1.2B . An unidentified model enables A. (pronounced “a dot”), a virtual assistant for the company’s mobile users.\nWhy it matters: AI models have a bright future in virtually every industry, and specialized AI models have an even brighter outlook. Like BloombergGPT , this partnership represents a step toward adapting foundation models to a vertical industry, along with a new business model for good measure. We’re thinking: Prompting a foundation model can go a long way in tasks for which it’s easy to write instructions that describe clearly what you want done. But many tasks involve specialized knowledge that’s difficult to put into a prompt; for instance, consider explaining how to draft a good legal document. In such cases, fine-tuning or specialized training can be a promising approach.\n\n\n",
