  "text": "A South African startup aims to lure talented engineers who left the continent to work abroad.\nWhat’s new: Johannesburg research lab Lelapa.ai bills itself as a haven for African AI engineers who want to work on challenges that aren’t on Silicon Valley’s agenda, Wired reported . The company purports to focus on languages such as isiZulu that big-tech natural language models don’t accommodate. How it works: Lelapa develops AI models for other businesses and nonprofits. The company has raised $2.5 million from institutions including Mozilla Ventures, Africa-centric investor Atlantica Ventures, and private investors including Google AI chief Jeff Dean. Current projects include:\nVulavula , a service that provides multilingual intent detection, translation, and transcription\nAn unnamed data-mining service for Open Restitution Africa , a nonprofit that retrieves African artifacts held in overseas museums\nA machine translation service that helps mothers connect with healthcare professionals\nBehind the news: Lelapa’s founders include some organizers of Deep Learning Indaba , a machine learning conference most recently held in Tunisia, and Masakhane , a nonprofit that promotes open-source models and datasets for African languages. Co-founder Jade Abbott was profiled in DeepLearning.AI’s Working AI blog series.\nWhy it matters: Over 74 percent of foreign-born students who receive a PhD in AI from a school in the United States remain in the U.S. after graduating, last year’s State of AI report found . Lelapa’s founders hope their project will help Africa reclaim some of this talent, nurture native AI startups, and address systemic inequities in AI development.\nWe’re thinking: Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 15 percent of the world’s population but fewer than 1 percent of AI patents and conference publications, according to the State of AI report. Organizations like Lelapa can help the region realize its potential.\n\n\n",
