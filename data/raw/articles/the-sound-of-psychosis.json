  "text": "Neuroscientists developed a system that, they say, can detect subtle signs of psychosis in conversational speech. Whatâ€™s new: Researchers at Emory School of Medicine used machine learning to predict the onset of schizophrenia in a high-risk population with 80 percent accuracy. Their results were published in the journal npj Schizophrenia . How it works: The researchers trained their neural network on thousands of conversations from Reddit to establish conversational norms and organize word vectors by usage.\nThey fed the system transcripts of interviews between young people at high risk of psychosis and their doctors, labeled to indicate speakers who eventually developed schizophrenia.\nAmong patients who eventually developed the disease, the researchers found higher rates of two verbal tics: words related to sound (such as loud, hush, and whisper) and use of multiple words with similar meanings.\nWhy It matters: Schizophrenia is a devastating condition that has no cure, but early detection can help people seek treatment before it becomes overwhelming. Takeaway: Methods exist to identify warning signs of schizophrenia in patients as young as 17, but only around 30 percent of these people eventually develop the disorder. Machine-learning techniques could help doctors spot the patients who really need help.\n\n\n",
