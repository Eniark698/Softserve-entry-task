  "text": "U.S. authorities, in a bid to stop aliens from overstaying their visas, aim to apply face recognition to nearly all travelers leaving the U.S.\nWhat’s new: Within four years, U.S. Customs and Border Protection expects to scan the faces of 97 percent of air travelers leaving the U.S., according to a new report from the Dept. of Homeland Security.\nHow it works: Passengers approaching airport gates will be photographed and their faces will be compared to collected photos from passports, visas, and earlier border crossings. If the system finds a match, it creates an exit record. Behind the news: The CBP plan is already well underway:\nThe agency has been scanning faces in 15 airports since late last year.\nJetBlue rolled out face recognition at New York’s JFK International Airport in November.\nOther airports have committed to implementing the technology, the DHS says.\nWhy it matters: Face recognition is a flashpoint for discussions of ethics in AI. Microsoft refused to supply it to a California law enforcement agency over concern that built-in bias would work against women and minorities. Amazon employees have petitioned the company to stop selling similar technology to law enforcement agencies.\nBottom line: U.S. companies are wrestling with self-regulation in lieu of legal limits on how AI can be used. Their choices will have a huge impact on the industry and society at large.\n\n\n",
