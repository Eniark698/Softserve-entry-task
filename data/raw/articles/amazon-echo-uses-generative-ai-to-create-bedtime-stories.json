  "text": "Too exhausted (or unimaginative) to tell your child a bedtime story? Amazon’s smart displays can spin bespoke tales on demand. What’s new: A feature called Create with Alexa generates children’s stories complete with illustrations, music, and sound effects on the Amazon Echo Show device.\nHow it works: The screen presents a series of prompts that provide a setting (such as “space exploration” or “enchanted forest”), main character (such as an astronaut or an alien), principal color, and tone (such as “happy” or “mysterious”).\nA language model trained on written stories produces five to 10 lines of text divided into five scenes.\nFor each scene, a  scene-generation model selects an appropriate background image from a library of human-created and AI-generated pictures. The model adds objects and characters, including facial expressions and gestures that match the text; for instance, a laughing pirate who waves her hands.\nAn audio generator produces music by melding a library of chords, harmonies, and rhythms.\nBehind the news: Amazon is under pressure to revitalize its 10-year-old Echo line. The devices, which have been sold at a loss on the theory that they would spur purchases of other goods, lost $10 billion in 2022 alone, and the division responsible for the Alexa software faces steep layoffs. Why it matters: AI models that generate text, images, video, and music are having a banner year . Alexa’s storytelling feature coordinates several generative models into a coherent whole. Whether it will spur sales is a tale for another time. We’re thinking: Once upon a time, there was a boy in a blue shirt who dreamed of changing the world with AI. . . .\n\n\n",
