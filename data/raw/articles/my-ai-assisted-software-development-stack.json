  "text": "Dear friends,\nUsing AI-assisted coding to build software prototypes is an important way to quickly explore many ideas and invent new things. In this and future letters, I’d like to share with you some best practices for prototyping simple web apps. This letter will focus on one idea: being opinionated about the software stack.\nThe software stack I personally use changes every few weeks. There are many good alternatives to these choices, and if you pick a preferred software stack and become familiar with its components, you’ll be able to develop more quickly. But as an illustration, here’s my current default:\nPython with FastAPI for building web-hosted APIs: I develop primarily in Python, so that’s a natural choice for me. If you’re a JavaScript/TypeScript developer, you’ll likely make a different choice. I’ve found FastAPI really easy to use and scalable for deploying web services (APIs) hosted in Python.\nUvicorn to run the backend application server (to execute code and serve web pages) for local testing on my laptop.\nIf deploying on the cloud, then either Heroku for small apps or Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk for larger ones (disclosure: I serve on Amazon’s board of directors): There are many services for deploying jobs, including HuggingFace Spaces, Railway, Google’s Firebase, Vercel, and others. Many of these work fine, and becoming familiar with just 1 or 2 will simplify your development process.\nMongoDB for NoSQL database: While traditional SQL databases are amazing feats of engineering that result in highly efficient and reliable data storage, the need to define the database structure (or schema) slows down prototyping. If you really need speed and ease of implementation, then dumping most of your data into a NoSQL (unstructured or semi-structured) database such as MongoDB lets you write code quickly and sort out later exactly what you want to do with the data. This is sometimes called schema-on-write, as opposed to schema-on-read. Mind you, if an application goes to scaled production, there are many use cases where a more structured SQL database is significantly more reliable and scalable.\nOpenAI’s o1 and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet for coding assistance, often by prompting directly (when operating at the conceptual/design level). Also occasionally Cursor (when operating at the code level): I hope never to have to code again without AI assistance! Claude 3.5 Sonnet is widely regarded as one of the best coding models. And o1 is incredible at planning and building more complex software modules, but you do have to learn to prompt it differently .\nOn top of all this, of course, I use many AI tools to manage agentic workflows, data ingestion, retrieval augmented generation, and so on. DeepLearning.AI and our wonderful partners offer courses on many of these tools.\nMy personal software stack continues to evolve regularly. Components enter or fall out of my default stack every few weeks as I learn new ways to do things. So please don’t feel obliged to use the components I do, but perhaps some of them can be a helpful starting point if you are still deciding what to use. Interestingly, I have found most LLMs not very good at recommending a software stack. I suspect their training sets include too much “hype” on specific choices, so I don’t fully trust them to tell me what to use. And if you can be opinionated and give your LLM directions on the software stack you want it to build on, I think you’ll get better results.\nA lot of the software stack is still maturing, and I think many of these components will continue to improve. With my stack, I regularly build prototypes in hours that, without AI assistance, would have taken me days or longer. I hope you, too, will have fun building many prototypes!\nKeep learning,\nAndrew\n\n\n",
