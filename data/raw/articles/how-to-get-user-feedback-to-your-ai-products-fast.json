  "text": "Dear friends,\nStartups live or die by their ability to execute at speed . For large companies, too, the speed with which an innovation team is able to iterate has a huge impact on its odds of success. Generative AI makes it possible to quickly prototype AI capabilities. AI capabilities that used to take months can sometimes be built in days or hours by simply prompting a large language model. I find this speed exciting and have been thinking about how to help startups and large companies alike go faster.\nI’ve been obsessed with speedy execution for a long time. When working on a project, I am loath to take two weeks to do something that I could do in one week. The price of moving at that pace is not that we take one week longer (which might be okay) but that we’re 2x slower (which is not)!\nWhen building an AI-powered product, there are many steps in designing, building, shipping, and scaling the product that are distinct from building the AI capability, and our ability to execute these other steps has not sped up as much as the AI part. But the speed with which we can prototype AI creates significant pressure to speed up these other steps, too. If it took 6 months to collect data, train a supervised learning algorithm, and deploy the model to the cloud, it might be okay to take 2 months to get user feedback. But if it takes a week to build a prototype, waiting 2 months for feedback seems intolerably slow!\nI’d like to focus on one key step of building applications: getting user feedback. A core part of the iterative workflow of designing and building a product (popularized by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup ) is to build a prototype (or MVP, minimum viable product), get user feedback on it, and to use that feedback to drive improvements. The faster you can move through this loop — which may require many iterations — the faster you can design a product that fits the market. This is why AI Fund, a venture studio that I lead, uses many fast, scrappy tactics to get feedback.\nFor B2C (business to consumer) offerings, here is a menu of some options for getting customer feedback:\nAsk 3 friends or team members to look at the product and let you know what they think (this might take ~0.5 days).\nAsk 10 friends or team members to take a look (~2 days).\nSend it to 100 trusted/volunteer alpha testers (~1 week?).\nSend it to 1,000 users to get qualitative or quantitative feedback (~2 weeks?).\nIncorporate it into an existing product to get feedback (1 to 2 months?).\nRoll it out to a large user base of an existing product and do rigorous A/B testing.\nAs we go down this list, we get (probably) more accurate feedback, but the time needed to get that feedback increases significantly. Also, the tactics at the top of the list create basically no risk, and thus it’s safe to repeatedly call on them, even with preliminary ideas and prototypes. Another advantage of the tactics further up the list is that we get more qualitative feedback (for example, do users seem confused? Are they telling us they really need one additional feature?), which sparks better ideas for how to change our product than an A/B test, which tells us with rigor whether a particular implementation works but is less likely to point us in new directions to try. I recommend using the fast feedback tactics first. As we exhaust the options for learning quickly, we can try the slower tactics.\nWith these tactics, scrappy startup leaders and innovation-team leaders in large companies can go faster and have a much higher chance of success.\nThe mantra “move fast and break things” got a bad reputation because, well, it broke things. Unfortunately, some have interpreted this to mean we should not move fast, but I disagree. A better mantra is “move fast and be responsible.” There are many ways to prototype and test quickly without shipping a product that can cause significant harm. In fact, prototyping and testing/auditing quickly before launching to a large audience is a good way to identify and mitigate potential problems.\nThere are numerous AI opportunities ahead, and our tools are getting better and better to pursue them at speed, which I find exhilarating!\nKeep learning!\nAndrew\n\n\n",
