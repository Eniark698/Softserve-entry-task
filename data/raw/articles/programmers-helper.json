  "text": "TabNine, a maker of programming tools, released Deep TabNine , an app that installs on your text editor of choice and fills in code as you type. How it works: Deep TabNine is based on OpenAI's GPT-2, the text generator that penned a decent dystopian short story based on a single sentence from George Orwell’s 1984 . Trained on open-source code, it predicts the next chunk of code, as illustrated in the picture above.\nDeep TabNine was trained on 2 million Github files.\nIt supports 22 programming languages.\nIndividuals can buy a license for $49. Business licenses cost $99.\nBehind the news: Predictive tools for coding have existed for years, but they're typically geared for a single language and base their predictions largely on what has already been typed, making them less useful early in a project. Thanks to GitHub, Deep TabNine is familiar with a range of tasks, algorithms, coding styles, and languages. Why it matters: Deep TabNine cuts coding time, especially when typing rote functions, according to evaluations on Reddit and Hacker News. Compounded across the entire software industry, it could be a meaningful productivity booster. And that doesn’t count the doctor bills saved by avoiding screen-induced migraines. We’re thinking: Pretrained language models like GPT-2 are opening new, sometimes worrisome possibilities for text generation. Could this be the start of a new, powerful wave of AI-driven coding tools?\n\n\n",
