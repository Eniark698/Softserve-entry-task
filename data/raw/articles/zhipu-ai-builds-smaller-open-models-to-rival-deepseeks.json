  "text": "In today’s edition, you’ll learn more about:\nMicrosoft adds search and research tools and an Agent Store\nAdobe updates its image model, opens door to competitors\nUnderstanding why AI models react the way they do\nDia, an open speech-to-text model to rival ElevenLabs and NotebookLM\nBut first:\nGLM-4-32B open models compete with GPT-4o, DeepSeek V3\nZhipu AI introduced its new GLM-4-32B-0414 series of open-weights models, featuring 32 billion parameters and performance comparable to OpenAI’s GPT models. The model lineup includes specialized variants: GLM-Z1-32B-0414 for deep thinking and reasoning tasks, GLM-Z1-Rumination-32B-0414 for complex open-ended problems with integrated search tools, and a smaller 9 billion parameter model (GLM-Z1-9B-0414) for resource-constrained deployments. According to benchmarks, some of the models’ capabilities rival much larger models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B), particularly in areas like coding, generating artifacts, and creating reports. All of the GLM-4 model weights are freely available for download under an Apache 2.0 license.

Founder Robin Li announced that Ernie 4.5 Turbo costs 80 percent less than its predecessor, while Ernie X1 Turbo is half the price of the original X1 model, competitively positioning these offerings against rivals like Alibaba’s Qwen and DeepSeek. Baidu also introduced Xinxiang, an AI agent platform that can automate everyday tasks, and revealed it has produced 30,000 AI chips currently in use. These moves come as Baidu attempts to regain momentum in China’s AI race, where its early lead with the first ChatGPT-like chatbot has been challenged by offerings from ByteDance, Moonshot AI, and other competitors.

Microsoft is building an Agent Store where users can access both Microsoft’s own and third-party agents from companies like Jira and Monday.com. The update also includes two new reasoning agents — Researcher and Analyst — powered by OpenAI’s deep reasoning models. Other key additions include AI-powered enterprise search that connects to multiple apps, personalized memory features, GPT-4o-powered image generation for business content, and Copilot Notebooks for organizing and analyzing diverse content. The new features are rolling out to existing Microsoft 365 Copilot subscribers, which remains priced at $30 per user per month on top of standard Microsoft 365 subscriptions.

The company introduced both standard and “Ultra” versions of Image Model 4, with the latter specializing in complex scenes with fine details. Firefly also supports text to video and text to vector graphics, both of which can be further edited using Adobe’s software. Adobe also unveiled a redesigned web app that integrates its own AI models alongside those from competitors like OpenAI and Google, and plans to expand Firefly’s accessibility by releasing iOS and Android mobile apps soon. Each Firefly generation costs credits allocated through an Adobe Creative Cloud plan. ( Adobe )\nNew research from Anthropic shows how AI assistants express values\nAnthropic’s Societal Impacts team has created a system to analyze the values expressed by their AI assistant Claude during actual user interactions. Researchers examined 700,000 anonymized conversations, identifying five major value categories: Practical, Epistemic, Social, Protective, and Personal. The study revealed that Claude generally adheres to Anthropic’s “helpful, honest, and harmless” training goals, with values like “professionalism” and “transparency” appearing frequently. The research also showed Claude’s values shift contextually, sometimes mirroring user values (28.2 percent of conversations) or occasionally resisting them (3 percent of conversations). This methodology provides a new way to monitor AI behavior in real-world settings and could potentially help identify jailbreak attempts.

The model supports advanced features like emotional tone, speaker tagging, and nonverbal audio cues such as laughs and coughs — capabilities that co-creator Toby Kim claims surpass competing offerings from ElevenLabs and Google’s NotebookLM. Side-by-side comparisons show Dia handling natural timing, nonverbal expressions, and emotional range quite effectively, with examples demonstrating how it properly interprets cues that other models simply read aloud or skip entirely. The model is available under an Apache 2.0 license, allowing commercial use while running on consumer-grade GPUs with about 10GB of VRAM.
