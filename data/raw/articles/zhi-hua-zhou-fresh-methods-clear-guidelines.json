  "text": "I have three hopes for 2020:\nHope that advanced machine learning techniques beyond deep neural networks can emerge. Neural networks have been studied and applied by many researchers, engineers, and practitioners for a long time. Other machine learning techniques offer relatively unexplored spaces for technical innovation.\nHope that AI can come into more fields and bring more positive changes to people’s everyday lives.\nHope for more thinking and discussion about what AI researchers, engineers, and practitioners must do to prevent wrong developments or misuses of AI techniques.\nZhi-Hua Zhou is a professor of computer science and artificial intelligence at Nanjing University.\n\n\n",
