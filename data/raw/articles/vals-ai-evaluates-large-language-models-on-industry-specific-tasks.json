  "text": "How well do large language models respond to professional-level queries in various industry domains? A new company aims to find out.\nWhat’s new: Vals.AI , an independent model testing service, developed benchmarks that rank large language models’ performance of tasks associated with income taxes, corporate finance, and contract law; it also maintains a pre-existing legal benchmark. Open AI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus did especially well in recent tests.\nHow it works: Vals AI hosts leaderboards that compare the performance of several popular large language models (LLMs) with respect to accuracy, cost, and speed, along with with analysis of the results. The company worked with independent experts to develop multiple-choice and open-ended questions in industrial domains. The datasets are not publicly available.\nContractLaw includes questions related to contracts. They ask models to retrieve parts of contracts that are relevant to particular terms, edit excerpts, and determine whether excerpts meet legal standards.\nCorpFin tests accuracy in answering corporate finance questions. It feeds to models a public commercial credit agreement — terms of a business loan or a line of credit — and poses questions that require extracting information and reasoning over it.\nTaxEval tests accuracy on tax-related prompts. Half of the questions test skills like calculating taxable income, marginal rate, and the like. The other half cover knowledge such as how different accounting methods impact taxes or how taxes apply to various types of assets.\nVals AI also tracks performance on LegalBench , an open benchmark that evaluates legal reasoning.\nResults: Among 15 models, GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus dominated Vals.AI’s leaderboards as of April 11, 2024. GPT-4 topped CorpFin and TaxEval, correctly answering 64.8 and 54.5 percent of questions, respectively. Claud 3 Opus narrowly beat GPT-4 on ContractLaw and LegalBench, achieving 74.0 and 77.7 percent, respectively. The smaller Claude 3 Sonnet took third place in ContractLaw, CorpFin, and TaxEval with 67.6, 61.4, and 37.1 percent. Google’s Gemini Pro 1.0 took third place in LegalBench with 73.6 percent.\nBehind the news: Many practitioners in finance and law use LLMs in applications that range from processing documents to predicting interest rates . However, LLM output in such applications requires oversight. In 2023, a New York state judge reprimanded a lawyer for submitting an AI-generated brief that referred to fictitious cases.\nWhy it matters: Typical AI benchmarks are designed to evaluate general knowledge and cognitive abilities. Many developers would like to measure more directly performance in real-world business contexts, where specialized knowledge may come into play.\nWe’re thinking: Open benchmarks can benefit from public scrutiny, and they’re available to all developers. However, they can be abused when developers cherry-pick benchmarks on which their models perform especially well. Moreover, they may find their way into training sets, making for unfair comparisons. Independent testing on proprietary benchmarks is one way to address these issues.\n\n\n",
