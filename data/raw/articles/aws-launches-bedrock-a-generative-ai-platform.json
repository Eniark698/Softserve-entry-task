  "text": "Amazon joined big-tech peers Google, Meta, and Microsoft in rolling out services that provide generated text and images.\nWhat’s new: The online retailer launched early access to Bedrock, a cloud platform that offers generative models built by Amazon and its partners. How it works: Bedrock is aimed at business customers, who can select among image- and text-generation models and fine-tune them for proprietary uses. It’s available to selected customers of Amazon Web Services as a “limited preview.” The price has yet to be announced.\nThe platform hosts Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion for image generation. This arrangement extends a partnership announced in November, when Stability AI named Amazon Web Services its preferred provider of cloud processing and storage.\nIt offers two third-party language models: AI21’s Jurassic-2 for composing stand-alone text and Anthropic’s Claude for conversational applications such as answering questions.\nBedrock also includes two language models developed by Amazon based on Titan . Titan Text generates and summarizes text, while Titan Embeddings generates text embeddings.\nBehind the news: Amazon’s peers offer similar capabilities via their respective cloud services.\nEarlier this month, Meta announced plans to launch a tool, powered by an in-house language model, to help advertisers generate ad copy.\nIn March, Google announced an API for the PaLM language model as well as tools for building generative text apps on Google Cloud.\nMicrosoft Azure offers access to OpenAI models including GPT-4 for generating text and DALL·E 2 for generating images.\nWhy it matters: Between Amazon and other cloud computing providers, generative AI rapidly is becoming available to developers of all kinds. We’re thinking: DALL·E 2 and ChatGPT debuted less than a year ago. Generative AI is gathering momentum at warp speed!\n\n\n",
